##### motivation

- *Every day should have all the times-of-day* (except where timezone changes apply)

- The `Time` type from Dates supports nanoseconds when dates are not used.
- `Time` works incompletely with`DateTime` which is limited to milliseconds.

- We need date-and-time together, fully resolved, accurate and precise.
  - `NanoDate` is familiar and effective
    -  works well with Dates
    -  uses `DateTime` methods

- This package is a redesign of `TimesDates`
  - `TimesDates` is widely used and well-liked
    - offers nanoseond resolved dates       (as do we)
    - offers nanosecond accurate time zones (we do not)

- Latest
  - performant NanoDate ranges with steps that are simple or compound periods
    - much faster than Dates with compound period stepsizes
  - bugfix (parsing some subsecond layouts)
    
- Contributors are welcome
  -  clear code, robust performance, reliable interoperability
  -  frendly docs, easily followed, well explained
